# FacebookMessengerUWP

This is a very basic FB Messenger Hosted Web App for Windows 10. It is just a web wrapper, it does not include W10 APIs integration (that would require server access).

This project is just intended as a showcase of the UWP Hosted Web Apps. Facebook Messenger is a registered trademark of Facebook Inc.
